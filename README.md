This project is a plugin for Wordpress.<br>
It adds a simple floating button to your page.

## How to install and use it?

First of all - it's a Wordpress plugin, so you need active Wordpress installation.<br>
To install this plugin just copy entire folder ```kj-simple-button``` to your ```/wp-content/plugins/``` catalog. After that hit Activate in Plugins page in your admin dashboard.

For now this plugin doesn't do much - it appends a red button to a document.
